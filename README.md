# Market-Basket-Analysis-
Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a data mining technique used to discover associations between products purchased together.  The Apriori algorithm is a popular choice for this analysis, as it identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules from transaction data. 
Objective:
The main goal is to uncover relationships between items that frequently appear together in transactions. For example, identifying that customers who buy bread often buy butter helps retailers optimize product placement and promotions.

Steps Involved:

Data Collection and Preparation:
Gather transactional data from point-of-sale (POS) systems. Each transaction represents a basket containing one or more items.

Preprocessing:
Format the data into a structured format (like lists of purchased items). Clean the data to remove inconsistencies.

Applying the Apriori Algorithm:

Frequent Itemset Generation: Identify sets of items that appear frequently together, based on a minimum support threshold.
Association Rule Mining: Extract rules from the frequent itemsets, focusing on metrics like support, confidence, and lift.
Support measures the frequency of an itemset.
Confidence indicates the likelihood of purchasing an item, given the presence of another.
Lift shows how much more likely items are to be bought together compared to random chance.
Evaluation and Interpretation:
Analyze the generated rules to identify meaningful patterns. For example, rules like {diapers} â†’ {baby wipes} with high confidence suggest actionable insights for product bundling.
